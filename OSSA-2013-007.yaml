title: 'Backend credentials leak in Glance v1 API'

description: 'Stuart McLaren from HP reported a vulnerability in the information potentially
  returned to the user in Glance v1 API. If an authenticated user requests, through
  the v1 API, an image that is already cached, the headers returned may disclose the
  Glance operator''s backend credentials for that endpoint. Only setups accepting
  the Glance v1 API and using either the single-tenant Swift store or S3 store are
  affected.'
