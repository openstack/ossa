advisory-title: 'Revoking a role does not affect existing tokens'

advisory-description: 'Dolph Mathews reported a vulnerability in Keystone. Granting
  and revoking roles from a user is not reflected upon token validation for pre-existing
  tokens. Pre-existing tokens continue to be valid for the original set of roles for
  the remainder of the token''s lifespan, or until explicitly invalidated. This fix
  invalidates all tokens held by a user upon role grant/revoke to circumvent the issue. '
