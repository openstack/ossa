title: 'Revoking a role does not affect existing tokens'

description: 'Dolph Mathews reported a vulnerability in Keystone. Granting and revoking
  roles from a user is not reflected upon token validation for pre-existing tokens.
  Pre-existing tokens continue to be valid for the original set of roles for the remainder
  of the token''s lifespan, or until explicitly invalidated. This fix invalidates
  all tokens held by a user upon role grant/revoke to circumvent the issue. '
