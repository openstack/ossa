title: 'Keystone client local information disclosure'

description: 'Jake Dahn from Nebula reported a vulnerability that the keystone client
  only allows passwords to be updated in a clear text command-line argument, which
  may enable other local users to obtain sensitive information by listing the process
  and potentially leaves a record of the password within the shell command history.'
