advisory-title: 'Potential Nova denial of service through compressed disk images'

advisory-description: 'Bernhard M. Wiedemann from SUSE reported a vulnerability in
  Nova''s control of the size of disk images. By using malicious compressed qcow2
  disk images, an authenticated user may consume large amounts of disk space for each
  image, potentially resulting in a Denial of Service attack on Nova compute nodes
  (CVE-2013-4463). While fixing this issue, Pádraig Brady from Red Hat additionally
  discovered that OSSA 2013-012 did not fully address CVE-2013-2096 in the non-default
  case where use_cow_images=False, and malicious qcow images are being transferred
  from Glance. In that specific case, an authenticated user could still consume large
  amounts of disk space for each instance using the malicious image, potentially also
  resulting in a Denial of Service attack on Nova compute nodes (CVE-2013-4469). The
  provided fixes address both issues.'
