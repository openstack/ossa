title: 'XSS vulnerability in Horizon log viewer'

description: 'Matthias Weckbecker reported a vulnerability in Horizon. He noted that
  the log viewer refreshing mechanism does not escape the data fetched from guest
  consoles. This means that HTML with Javascript code gets interpreted as such, resulting
  in the ability to inject code into a dashboard session. '
