advisory-title: 'XSS vulnerability in Horizon log viewer'

advisory-description: 'Matthias Weckbecker reported a vulnerability in Horizon. He
  noted that the log viewer refreshing mechanism does not escape the data fetched
  from guest consoles. This means that HTML with Javascript code gets interpreted
  as such, resulting in the ability to inject code into a dashboard session. '
