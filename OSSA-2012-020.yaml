title: 'Information leak in libvirt LVM-backed instances'

description: 'Eric Windisch from Cloudscaling reported a vulnerability in libvirt
  LVM-backed instances. The physical volume content was not wiped out before being
  deallocated and passed to an instance, which may result in the disclosure of information
  from previously-allocated logical volumes.Only setups using libvirt and LVM-backed
  instances (libvirt_images_type=lvm) are affected. '
