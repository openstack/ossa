advisory-title: 'Keystone user and group id mismatch'

advisory-description: 'Michael Stancampiano from IBM reported a vulnerability in Keystone.
  Someone with write access to the user and group repository (such as the LDAP directory
  server) may willingly or unwillingly grant additional rights by picking the same
  IDs for users and groups, resulting in roles assigned to a group being assigned
  to the affected user even if he is not a member of this group. Only Keystone setups
  using LDAP for the Identity driver are affected.'
