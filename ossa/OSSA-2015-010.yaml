title: 'XSS in Horizon Heat stack creation'

description: 'Nikita Konovalov from Mirantis reported a vulnerability in Horizon.
    By tricking a Horizon user into using a malicious template in the
    Orchestration/Stack section of Horizon, a remote attacker may trigger
    a cross-site-scripting vulnerability during the stack creation. It
    may result in potential assets theft like user access credentials.
    Only setups exposing the orchestration dashboard in Horizon
    are affected.'
