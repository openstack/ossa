title: 'Neutron L3-agent DoS through IPv6 subnet'

description: 'Thiago Martins from Hewlett Packard reported a vulnerability in Neutron
  L3-agent. By creating an IPv6 private subnet attached to a L3 router, an authenticated
  user may break the L3-agent, preventing further floating IPv4 addresses from being

  attached for the entire cloud. Note: removal of the faulty network can not be done
  using the API and must be cleaned at the database level. Only Neutron setups using
  IPv6 and L3-agent are affected.'
