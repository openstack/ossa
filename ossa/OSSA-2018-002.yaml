title: GET /v3/OS-FEDERATION/projects leaks project information

description: >
  Kristi Nikolla with Boston University reported a vulnerability
  in Keystone federation. By doing GET /v3/OS-FEDERATION/projects
  an authenticated user may discover projects they have no
  authority to access, leaking all projects in the deployment and
  their attributes.
  Only Keystone with the /v3/OS-FEDERATION endpoint enabled via
  policy.json is affected.
