title: Routes middleware memory leak for nonexistent controllers

description: >
  Slawek Kaplonski with Red Hat reported a vulnerability in Neutron's routes
  middleware. By making API requests involving nonexistent controllers, an
  authenticated user may cause the API worker to consume increasing amounts of
  memory, resulting in API performance degradation or denial of service. All
  Neutron deployments are affected.
