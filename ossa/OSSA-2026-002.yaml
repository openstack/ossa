title: Nova calls qemu-img without format restrictions for resize

description: >
  Dan Smith from Red Hat reported a vulnerability in nova. By
  writing a malicious QCOW header to a root or ephemeral disk and
  then triggering a resize, a user may convince Nova's flat image
  backend to call qemu-img without a format restriction resulting in
  an unsafe image resize operation that could destroy data on the
  host system. Only compute nodes using the Flat image backend
  (usually configured with use_cow_images=False) are affected.
