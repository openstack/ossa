title: 'TLS cert verification option not honoured in paste configs'

description: 'Qin Zhao from IBM reported a vulnerability in keystonemiddleware
  (formerly shipped as python-keystoneclient). When the "insecure" option
  is set in a paste configuration file it is effectively ignored,
  regardless of its value. As a result certificate verification will be
  disabled, leaving TLS connections open to MITM attacks. All versions of
  keystonemiddleware with TLS settings configured via a paste.ini file are
  affected by this flaw.'
