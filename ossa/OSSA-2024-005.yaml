title: Authorization bypassed when setting tags on Neutron networks

description: |+
  Tore Anderson of Redpill Linpro AS discovered that Neutron does not apply
  the proper policy check for changing network tags. An unprivileged tenant
  is able to change (add and clear) tags on network objects which do not
  belong to the tenant, and this action is not being subjected to the
  proper policy authorization check.
