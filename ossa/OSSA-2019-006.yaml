title: 'Credentials API allows listing and retrieving of all users credentials'

description: >
    Daniel Preussker reported a vulnerability in Keystone's list credentials
    API. Any user with a role on a project is able to list any credentials
    with the /v3/credentials API when [oslo_policy] enforce_scope is false.
    Users with a role on a project are able to view any other users
    credentials, which could leak sign-on information for Time-based One
    Time Passwords (TOTP) or othewise. Deployments running keystone with
    [oslo_policy] enforce_scope set to false are affected. There will be a
    slight performance impact for the list credentials API once this issue
    is fixed.
