title: Unvalidated image data passed to qemu-img

description: |+
  Dan Smith and Julia Kreger of Red Hat and Jay Faulkner of G-Research
  noticed a vulnerability in image processing for Ironic, in which a
  specially crafted image could be used by an authenticated user to
  exploit undesired behaviors in qemu-img, including possible unauthorized
  access to potentially sensitive data.

  Mitigation
  ----------
  The attached patches contain code allowing Ironic and the Ironic-Python-Agent
  (IPA) to pre-screen images before passing them to qemu-img.  You should
  patch both of them because in some popular deployment configurations, it is
  possible for images to bypass the Ironic conductor for more efficient image
  downloads.

  In situations where it is not possible to patch IPA, there is a new
  configuration option, ``[conductor]conductor_always_validates_images``.
  When this option is True, all image downloads are forced to occur through
  the Ironic conductor, where they are validated.  However, this may incur
  a significant performance hit; hence our recommendation to patch both Ironic
  and IPA.

  Patches are available for both Ironic and IPA for all maintained branches,
  namely, the Dalmatian development branch (current master) through Antelope.
  For these branches, ``conductor_always_validates_images`` defaults to False.

  For the unmaintained branches (Zed through Victoria), patches are not
  available for IPA due to a significant risk of regressions.  For these
  branches, the Ironic patches set ``conductor_always_validates_images`` to
  True, as this is the only safe way to run Ironic with an un-patched IPA.

  Cached images
  -------------
  Images in the Ironic image cache should be purged.  To purge the cache,
  stop the Ironic conductor and remove the files in the
  ``[pxe]instance_master_path`` directory on that conductor node.

  Supported image formats
  -----------------------
  A new configuration option, ``[conductor]permitted_image_formats`` controls
  what image formats will be accepted by Ironic.  By default, the allowed
  formats are 'raw' and 'qcow2', which are the only formats that Ironic is
  tested with.  In previous releases, it was possible to use images of other,
  unsupported formats with Ironic, but this is now blocked by default due to
  security issues arising from the image conversion process.  It is possible,
  though not recommended, to expand the list of permitted formats.
  Alternatively, users requiring the use of an image in an unsupported format
  can convert the image offline into a supported format before uploading the
  image to Glance or otherwise making the image available to Ironic.  Consult
  the Ironic documentation for details.

  Warning
  -------
  As is well-documented, the OpenStack Ironic project does not support the
  use of ironic-lib for non-Ironic use cases.  In its normal supported context,
  ironic-lib assumes that images have been pre-screened before ironic-lib
  comes in contact with them.  Thus, unsupported use of ironic-lib leaves
  you vulnerable to the exploit outlined in this OSSA.

  The Ironic project intends eventually to explicitly remove the vulnerable
  methods in ironic-lib, but reminds the reader that independent use of
  ironic-lib is not supported.

  Bugfix branches
  ---------------
  Patches are available for maintained bugfix branches.  These patches will
  be merged to the maintained branches, but no new releases will be triggered
  from those branches.
