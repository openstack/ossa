title: "Nova VMware driver may connect VNC to another tenant's console"

description: 'Marcio Roberto Starke reported a vulnerability in the Nova VMware
  driver. A race condition in its VNC port allocation may cause it to
  connect the wrong console if instances are created concurrently. By
  repeatedly spawning new instances, an authenticated user may be able
  to gain unauthorized console access to instances belonging to other
  tenants. Only Nova setups using the VMware driver and the VNC proxy
  service are affected.'
