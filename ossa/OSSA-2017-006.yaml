title: >
  Nova FilterScheduler doubles resource allocations during rebuild with new
  image

description: >
  Matt Riedemann from Huawei reported a vulnerability in OpenStack Nova's
  default FilterScheduler. By repeatedly rebuilding an instance with new
  images, an authenticated user may consume untracked resources on a hypervisor
  host leading to a denial of service. This regression was introduced with the
  fix for OSSA-2017-005 (CVE-2017-16239), however, only Nova stable/pike or
  later deployments with that fix applied and relying on the default
  FilterScheduler are affected.
