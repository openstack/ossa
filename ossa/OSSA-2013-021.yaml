title: 'Cinder LVM volume driver does not support secure deletion'

description: 'Rongze Zhu from UnitedStack reported a vulnerability in the Cinder LVM
  volume driver. The contents of LVM snapshots may not be cleared upon deletion even
  when secure deletes are configured, resulting in potential exposure of latent data
  to subsequent servers for other tenants. Only setups using LVMVolumeDriver are affected.'
