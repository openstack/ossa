title: 'Backend password leak in Glance error message'

description: 'Dan Prince of Red Hat discovered an issue in Glance error reporting.
  By creating an image in Glance by URL that references a mis-configured Swift endpoint,
  or if the Swift endpoint that a previously-ACTIVE image references for any reason
  becomes unusable, an authenticated user may access the  Glance operator''s Swift
  credentials for that endpoint. Only setups that use the single-tenant Swift store
  are affected. '
