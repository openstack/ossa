title: Incorrect role assignment with federated Keystone

description: >
  Boris Bobrov from Mail.Ru reported a vulnerability in Keystone Federation. An
  authenticated user may receive all the roles assigned to the user's project
  regardless of the federation mapping when there are rules in which
  group-based assignments are not used. For example, by requesting an admin
  user to get a role in their project, the user may be granted the admin
  privileges for new scoped tokens. All setups using the Keystone federation
  without group based assignments rules are affected.
