title: 'Remote code execution in Glance Sheepdog backend'

description: 'Paul McMillan from Nebula reported a vulnerability in Glance Sheepdog
  backend. By using a specially crafted location, a user allowed to insert or modify
  Glance image metadata may trigger code execution on the Glance host as the user
  the Glance service runs under. This may result in Glance host unauthorized access
  and further compromise of the Glance service. All setups using Glance server with
  the (enabled by default) sheepdog backend are affected.'
