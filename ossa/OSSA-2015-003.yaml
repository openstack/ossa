title: 'Glance user storage quota bypass'

description: 'Tushar Patil from NTT reported a vulnerability in Glance. By deleting images
    that are being uploaded, a malicious user can overcome the storage quota and
    thus may overrun the backend. Images in deleted state are not taken into
    account by quota and won''t be effectively deleted until the upload is
    completed. Only Glance setups configured with user_storage_quota are
    affected.'
