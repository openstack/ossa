title: Arbitrary file access through custom S3 XML entities

description: >
  Sébastien Meriot (OVH) reported a vulnerability in Swift's S3 XML parser. By
  supplying specially crafted XML files an authenticated user may coerce the S3
  API into returning arbitrary file contents from the host server resulting in
  unauthorized read access to potentially sensitive data; this impacts both
  s3api deployments (Rocky or later), and swift3 deployments (Queens and
  earlier, no longer actively developed). Only deployments with S3
  compatibility enabled are affected.
