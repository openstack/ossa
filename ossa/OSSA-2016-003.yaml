title: 'Heat denial of service through template-validate'

description: 'Steven Hardy from Red Hat reported a vulnerability in Heat template
    validation. By referencing a local file like /dev/zero, an authenticated user
    may trick the heat engine service to load arbitrary local file content
    resulting in a Denial of Service attack through memory exhaustion. Note that
    the file content is not written back to the user, though the user can
    determine if a file exists and if it is readable by heat-engine. All Heat
    setups are affected.'
