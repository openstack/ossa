title: 'Nova host data leak through snapshot'

description: 'Matthew Booth from Red Hat reported a vulnerability in Nova instance
    snapshot. By overwriting the disk inside an instance with a malicious
    image and requesting a snapshot, an authenticated user would be able to
    read an arbitrary file from the compute host. Note that the host file
    needs to be readable by the nova user to be exposed except when using
    lvm for instance storage, when all files readable by root are exposed.
    Only setups using libvirt to spawn instances are vulnerable. Of these,
    setups which use filesystem storage, and do not set "use_cow_images =
    False" in Nova configuration are not affected. Setups which use ceph or
    lvm for instance storage, and setups which use filesystem storage with
    "use_cow_images = False" are all affected.'
