title: 'Neutron DoS through invalid DNS configuration'

description: 'Henry Yamauchi, Charles Neill and Michael Xin from Rackspace reported
    a vulnerability in Neutron. By configuring a maliciously crafted
    dns_nameservers an authenticated user may crash Neutron service
    resulting in a denial of service attack. All Neutron setups are affected.'

errata: 'The former fix did not take into account the usage of hostnames as
    nameserver and caused a regression for this use-case. This update
    provides an additional fix for that issue.'
