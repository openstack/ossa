title: 'Glance storage overrun'

description: 'Mike Fedosin and Alexei Galkin from Mirantis reported a vulnerability in
    Glance. By deleting images that are being uploaded using a token that is
    about to expire, a malicious user can overcome the storage quota and
    accumulate untracked image data in the backend resulting in potential
    resource exhaustion and denial of service. All Glance setups using the V1 API
    are affected and all setups using the V2 API with the registry db_api enabled
    are affected.'
