title: 'Potential denial of service on Nova when using Qpid'

description: 'Jaroslav Henner from Red Hat reported a vulnerability in Nova when using
  Apache Qpid as the RPC backend. By sending any random text longer than 65K characters
  to an instance console and requesting the console log contents through the API,
  an authenticated user may disrupt the nova-compute node his instance is running
  on. This vulnerability could be leveraged in a Denial of Service attack against
  the cloud provider. Only Folsom and Grizzly setups using Qpid as their RPC backend
  are affected. Havana setups, or setups using other RPC backends (like RabbitMQ),
  are all unaffected.'
