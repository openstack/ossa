title: 'Octavia Amphora-Agent not requiring Client-Certificate'

description: >
  Daniel Preussker reported a vulnerability in amphora-agent,
  running within Octavia Amphora Instances which allows
  unauthenticated access from the management network.
  This leads to information disclosure and also allows
  changes to the configuration of the Amphora via simple HTTP
  requests because cmd/agent.py gunicorn cert_reqs option is
  incorrectly set to True instead of ssl.CERT_REQUIRED.
