title: 'Glance image status manipulation through locations removal'

description: 'Erno Kuvaja from HPE reported a vulnerability in Glance. By removing the last
    location of an image, an authenticated user may change the image status back
    to queued and may be able to upload new image data resulting in a broken
    Glance''s immutability promise. A malicious tenant may exploit this flaw to
    silently replace image data it owns, regardless of the original creator or
    the visibility settings. Only setups with show_multiple_locations enabled
    (not default) are affected.'

notes:
  - 'This fix will be included in future 2015.1.3 (kilo) and 11.0.2 (liberty)
     releases.'
  - 'The proposed fix prevents the removal of the last location of an image so
     that an active image is always available. This action was previously
     incorrectly allowed and the fix might break some users who are relying on
     the false assumption that it would be ok to replace the data of existing
     image in the special case that the multiple locations has been configured.'
