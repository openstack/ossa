title: 'Xen connection password leak in logs via StorageError'

description: 'Matt Riedemann from IBM reported an information disclosure
    vulnerability in Nova. If a StorageError occurs when attempting to
    connect a volume using the Xen API, the connection parameters will
    be logged. These parameters may include credentials that are not
    masked. An attacker with read access to Nova logs could use these
    credentials with the Xen API directly. Only Nova deployments using
    the Xen backend are affected by this flaw.'
