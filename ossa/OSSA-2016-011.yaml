title: 'Nova may fail to delete images in resize state regression'

description: 'Rajesh Tailor from Red Hat reported a vulnerability in Nova. If an
    authenticated user deletes an instance while it is in resize state, it will
    cause the original instance to not be deleted from the compute node it was
    running on. An attacker can use this to launch a denial of service attack.
    All Nova setups are affected.'
