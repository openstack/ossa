title: 'Ageing time of 0 disables linuxbridge MAC learning'

description: >
  James Denton with Rackspace reported a vulnerability in os-vif, the
  Nova/Neutron network integration library. A hard-coded MAC ageing
  time of 0 disables MAC learning in linuxbridge, forcing obligatory
  Ethernet flooding for non-local destinations which both impedes
  network performance and allows users to possibly view the content of
  packets for instances belonging to other tenants sharing the same
  network. Only deployments using the linuxbridge backend are
  affected.
