title: 'Nova host data leak through resize/migration'

description: 'Matthew Booth from Red Hat reported a vulnerability in Nova instance
    resize/migration. By overwriting an ephemeral or root disk with a malicious
    image before requesting a resize, an authenticated user may be able to read
    arbitrary files from the compute host. Only setups using libvirt driver with
    raw storage and setting "use_cow_images = False" (not default) are affected.'

errata: 'The former fix did not take into account the usage of non-disk-image
    backends and caused a regression for this use-case. This update provides an
    additional fix for that issue.'
