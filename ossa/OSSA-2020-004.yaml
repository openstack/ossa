title: Keystone credential endpoints allow owner modification and are not protected from a scoped context

description: >
    kay reported two vulnerabilities in keystone's EC2 credentials API.
    Any authenticated user could create an EC2 credential for themselves
    for a project that they have a specified role on, then perform an update
    to the credential user and project, allowing them to masquerade as
    another user. (CVE-2020-12691)

    Any authenticated user within a limited scope
    (trust/oauth/application credential) can create an EC2 credential with
    an escalated permission, such as obtaining admin while the user is on
    a limited viewer role. (CVE-2020-12689)

    Both of these vulnerabilities potentially allow a malicious user to
    act as admin on a project that another user has the admin role on,
    which can effectively grant the malicious user global admin privileges.
