    An authenticated user may conduct a persistent XSS attack by setting a
    malicious metadata to a Glance image, a Nova flavor or a Host Aggregate and
    tricking an administrator to load the update metadata page. Once executed in
    a legitimate context this attack may result in a privilege escalation. All
    Horizon setups are affected.'
