title: Malicious qemu-img input may exhaust resources in Cinder, Glance, Nova

description: >
  Richard W.M. Jones of Red Hat reported a vulnerability that
  affects OpenStack Cinder, Glance and Nova. By providing a
  maliciously crafted disk image an attacker can consume
  considerable amounts of RAM and CPU time resulting in a denial of
  service via resource exhaustion. Any project which makes calls to
  qemu-img without appropriate ulimit restrictions in place is
  affected by this flaw.
