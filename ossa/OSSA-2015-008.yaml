title: 'Potential Keystone cache backend password leak in log'

description: 'Eric Brown from VMware reported a vulnerability in Keystone. The
    backend_argument configuration option content is being logged, and it may
    contain sensitive information for specific backends (like a password for
    MongoDB). An attacker with read access to Keystone logs may therefore obtain
    sensitive data about certain backends. All Keystone setups are potentially
    impacted.'
