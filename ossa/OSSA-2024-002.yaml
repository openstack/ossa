title: Incomplete file access fix and regression for QCOW2 backing
       files and VMDK flat descriptors

description: >
  Arnaud Morin (OVH) reported a vulnerability in Nova. By supplying
  a raw format image which is actually a specially crafted QCOW2
  image with a backing file path or VMDK flat image with a
  descriptor file path, an authenticated user may convince systems
  to return a copy of the referenced fileâ€™s contents from the server
  resulting in unauthorized access to potentially sensitive data.
  All Nova deployments are affected.

notes:
  - The patches linked above should apply cleanly to the public
    state of their respective branches at time of disclosure, and
    depend on some commits which merged after the `OSSA-2024-001
    <https://security.openstack.org/ossa/OSSA-2024-001.html>`_ fixes
    as well as the final states of the Nova changes linked from that
    advisory (those did see some minor adjustments before they
    merged).
  - The QCOW2 issue is due to an incomplete fix in OSSA-2024-001
    affecting systems where the ``use_cow_images`` configuration
    option is disabled, while the VMDK issue is a regression of the
    earlier `OSSA-2023-002
    <https://security.openstack.org/ossa/OSSA-2023-002.html>`_
    vulnerability reintroduced by the new implementation in
    OSSA-2024-001. Both problems were identified in the final hours
    before OSSA-2024-001 publication but, due to time constraints,
    were redacted from that bug and moved to a separate report.
  - Neither the methods introduced in these patches nor the fixes
    for OSSA-2024-001 are capable of blocking malicious images which
    are already resident in Nova's cache. At this time we do not
    have useful operator guidance for identifying and removing such
    existing images from the cache but strongly caution, if you do
    attempt to use the qemu-img tool to find them, to make sure
    you're using a version of it patched for `QEMU CVE-2024-4467
    <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-4467>`_.
