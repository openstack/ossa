title: 'Incorrect Audit IDs in Keystone Fernet Tokens can result in revocation bypass'

description: 'Lance Bragstad (Rackspace) reported a vulnerability in the Keystone
    Fernet Token Provider. By rescoping a token a user will receive a new token
    without correct audit_ids, these incorrect audit_ids will prevent the entire
    chain of tokens from being revoked properly. This vulnerability does not impact
    revoking a token by its individual audit_id. Only deployments with Keystone
    configured to use Fernet tokens are impacted.'
