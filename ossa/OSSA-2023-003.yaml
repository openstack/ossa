title: Unauthorized volume access through deleted volume attachments

description: |+
  An unauthorized access to a volume could occur when an iSCSI or FC
  connection from a host is severed due to a volume being unmapped on
  the storage system and the device is later reused for another volume
  on the same host.

  **Scope:** Only deployments with iSCSI or FC volumes are affected.
  However, the fix for this issue includes a configuration change in
  Nova and Cinder that may impact you on your next upgrade regardless
  of what backend storage technology you use. See the *Configuration
  change* section below, and item 4(B) in the *Patches and Associated
  Deployment Changes* for details.

  This data leak can be triggered by two different situations.

  **Accidental case:** If there is a problem with network connectivity
  during a normal detach operation, OpenStack may fail to clean the
  situation up properly. Instead of force-detaching the compute node
  device, Nova ignores the error, assuming the instance has already
  been deleted. Due to this incomplete operation OpenStack may end up
  selecting the wrong multipath device when connecting another volume
  to an instance.

  **Intentional case:** A regular user can create an instance with a
  volume, and then delete the volume attachment directly in Cinder,
  which neglects to notify Nova. The compute node SCSI plumbing (over
  iSCSI/FC) will continue trying to connect to the original
  host/port/LUN, not knowing the attachment has been deleted. If a
  subsequent volume attachment re-uses the host/port/LUN for a
  different instance and volume, the original instance will gain
  access to it once the SCSI plumbing reconnects.

  Configuration Change
  --------------------
  To prevent the intentional case, the Block Storage API provided by
  Cinder must only accept attachment delete requests from Nova for
  instance-attached volumes. A complicating factor is that Nova
  deletes an attachment by making a call to the Block Storage API on
  behalf of the user (that is, by passing the user's token), which
  makes the request indistinguishable from the user making this
  request directly. The solution is to have Nova include a service
  token along with the user's token so that Cinder can determine that
  the detach request is coming from Nova. The ability for Nova to pass
  a service token has been supported since Ocata, but has not been
  required until now. Thus, deployments that are not currently sending
  service user credentials from Nova will need to apply the relevant
  code changes and also make configuration changes to solve the
  problem.

  Patches and Associated Deployment Changes
  -----------------------------------------
  Given the above analysis, a thorough fix must include the following
  elements:

  1. The os-brick library must implement the ``force`` option for
     fibre channel, which which has only been available for iSCSI
     until now (covered by the linked patches).

  2. Nova must call os-brick with the ``force`` option when
     disconnecting volumes from deleted instances (covered by the
     linked patches).

  3. In deployments where Glance uses the cinder glance_store driver,
     glance must call os-brick with the ``force`` option when
     disconnecting volumes (covered by the linked patches).

  4. Cinder must distinguish between safe and unsafe attachment delete
     requests and reject the unsafe ones. This part of the fix has two
     components:

     a. The Block Storage API will return a 409 (Conflict) for a
        request to delete an attachment if there is an instance
        currently using the attachment, **unless** the request is
        being made by a service (for example, Nova) on behalf of a
        user (covered by the linked patches).

     b. In order to recognize that a request is being made by a
        service on behalf of a user, Nova must be configured to send a
        service token along with the user token. If this configuration
        change is not made, the cinder change will reject **any**
        request to delete an attachment associated with a volume that
        is attached to an instance. Nova must be configured to send a
        service token to Cinder, and Cinder must be configured to
        accept service tokens. This is described in the following
        document and **IS NOT AUTOMATICALLY APPLIED BY THE LINKED
        PATCHES:** (Using service tokens to prevent long-running job
        failures)
        https://docs.openstack.org/cinder/latest/configuration/block-storage/service-token.html
        The Nova patch mentioned in step 2 includes a similar document
        more focused on Nova:
        doc/source/admin/configuration/service-user-token.rst

  5. The cinder glance_store driver does not attach volumes to
     instances; instead, it attaches volumes directly to the Glance
     node. Thus, the Cinder change in step 4 will recognize an
     attachment-delete request coming from Glance as safe and allow
     it. (Of course, we expect that you will have applied the patches
     in steps 1 and 3 to your Glance nodes.)

errata: >
  An additional nova patch is required to fix a minor regression in
  periodic tasks and some nova-manage actions (errata 1). Also a patch
  to tempest is needed to account for behavior changes with fixes in
  place (errata 2). The stable/wallaby branch fix for nova introduced
  a regression which was addressed through subsequent adjustment of
  its patches after the advisory was published (errata 3).

notes:
  - Limited Protection Against Accidents... If you are only concerned with
    protecting against the accidental case described earlier in this document,
    steps 1-3 above should be sufficient. Note, however, that only applying
    steps 1-3 leaves your cloud wide open to the intentional exploitation of
    this vulnerability. Therefore, we recommend that the full fix be applied to
    all deployments.
