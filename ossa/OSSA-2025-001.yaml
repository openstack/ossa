title: Ironic fails to restrict paths used for file:// image URLs

description: |+
  Julia Kreger of Red Hat noticed a vulnerability in image handling for
  Ironic. A malicious project assigned as a node owner can provide a path to
  any local file readable by the ironic-conductor which may then be written
  to the target node disk. This is only possible via deployments
  performed directly via Ironic's API and cannot be triggered via Nova's virt
  driver.

  This is difficult to exploit in practice, as a node deployed in this manner
  should not ever reach ACTIVE state, but it still represents a danger in
  environments running with non-default, insecure configurations such as with
  automated cleaning disabled.

notes:
  - Patches have been provided for all supported Ironic branches. As a
    courtesy, we have also provided patches for some unmaintained branches and
    the recently end-of-life 2023.2/bobcat release. As usual, we will provide
    updated releases off maintained branches, but will not create new
    releases off bugfix or unmaintained branches.
