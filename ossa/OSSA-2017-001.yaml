title: CatchErrors leaks sensitive values in oslo.middleware

description: >
  Divya K Konoor with IBM reported a vulnerability in oslo.middleware.
  Software using the CatchError class may include sensitive values in
  the error message accompanying a Traceback, resulting in their
  disclosure. For example, complete API requests (including keystone
  tokens in their headers) may leak into neutron error logs.
