title: Unprivileged users can retrieve, use and manipulate share networks

description: >
    Tobias Rydberg from City Network Hosting AB reported a vulnerability with
    the manila's share network APIs. An attacker can retrieve and manipulate
    share networks that do not belong to them if they possess the share
    network ID. By exploiting this vulnerability, they can view and
    manipulate share network subnets and use the share network to create
    resources such as shares and share groups.
