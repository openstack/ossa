title: 'Glance Swift store backend password leak'

description: 'Nikhil Komawar from Rackspace reported an information leak in Glance
  logs. The password for the Swift store backend is logged at WARNING level as part
  of the URL when authentication to a store fails if image location is not disabled
  by policy or the store is a single-tenant configuration. An attacker with access
  to the logs (local shell, log aggregation system access, or accidental leak) may
  leverage this vulnerability to elevate privileges and gain direct full access to
  the Glance Swift store backend. Only Glance setups using the Swift store backend
  are affected.'
