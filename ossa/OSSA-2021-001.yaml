title: Anti-spoofing bypass for Open vSwitch networks

description: >
  David Sinquin with Gandi.net reported a vulnerability in Neutron's default
  Open vSwitch firewall rules. By sending carefully crafted packets, anyone in
  control of a server instance connected to the virtual switch can impersonate
  the IPv6 addresses of other systems on the network, resulting in denial of
  service or in some cases possibly interception of traffic intended for other
  destinations. Only deployments using the Open vSwitch driver are affected.
