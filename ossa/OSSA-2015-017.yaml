title: 'Nova may fail to delete images in resize state'

description: 'George Shuklin from Webzilla LTD and Tushar Patil from NTT DATA, Inc
    independently reported a vulnerability in Nova resize state. If an
    authenticated user deletes an instance while it is in resize state,
    it will cause the original instance to not be deleted from the
    compute node it was running on. An attacker can use this to launch a
    denial of service attack. All Nova setups are affected.'
