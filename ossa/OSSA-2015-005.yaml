title: 'Nova console Cross-Site WebSocket hijacking'

description: 'Brian Manifold from Cisco and Paul McMillan from Nebula reported a
    vulnerability in Nova console websocket. By tricking an authenticated user
    into visiting a malicious URL, a remote attacker or a man in the middle may
    exploit a cross-site-websocket-hijacking vulnerability resulting in potential
    hijack of consoles where the user is still logged in. Only Nova setups with
    vnc or spice enabled are affected.'
