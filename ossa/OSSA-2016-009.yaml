title: 'Neutron IPTables firewall anti-spoof protection bypass'

description: 'Romain Aviolat from Nagravision and Dustin Lundquist from
    Blue Box Group, Inc independently reported vulnerabilities in Neutron
    anti-spoof protection. By forging DHCP discovery messages or non-IP
    traffic, such as ARP or ICMPv6, an instance may spoof IP or MAC source
    addresses on attached networks resulting in denial of services and/or
    traffic interception. Moreover when L2population isn''t used, other
    tenants attached to a shared network are also vulnerable. Neutron
    setups using the IPTables firewall driver are affected.'
