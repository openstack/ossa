title: 'Glance import task leaks image in backend'

description: 'Abhishek Kekane from NTT and Mike Fedosin from Mirantis reported a
    vulnerability in the Glance import task. By creating numerous images using
    the task API and deleting them, an authenticated attacker may accumulate
    untracked image data in the backend resulting in potential resource
    exhaustion and denial of service. All glance setups using API v2 are
    affected.'
