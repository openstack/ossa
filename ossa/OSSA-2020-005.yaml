title: OAuth1 request token authorize silently ignores roles parameter

description: >
    kay reported a vulnerability in Keystone's OAuth1 Token API. The list of
    roles provided for an OAuth1 access token are ignored, so when an OAuth1
    access token is used to request a keystone token, the keystone token will
    contain every role assignment the creator had for the project instead
    of the provided subset of roles. This results in the provided keystone token
    having more role assignments than the creator intended, possibly giving
    unintended escalated access.
