title: 'Swift proxy-server DoS through Large Object'

description: 'Romain LE DISEZ from OVH and Örjan Persson from Kiliaro independently
    reported two vulnerabilities in Swift Large Object. By repeatedly
    requesting and interrupting connections to a Large Object (Dynamic or
    Static) URL, a remote attacker may exhausts Swift proxy-server
    resources, potentially resulting in a denial of service. Note that there
    are two distinct bugs that can exhaust proxy resources, one for client
    connection (client to proxy), one for servers connection (proxy to
    server). All Swift setup are affected.'
