title: 'Glance image status manipulation'

description: 'Hemanth Makkapati of Rackspace reported a vulnerability in
    Glance. By submitting a HTTP PUT request with a
    "x-image-meta-status" header, a tenant can manipulate the
    status of their images. A malicious tenant may exploit this
    flaw to reactivate disabled images, bypass storage quotas and
    in some cases replace image contents. Setups using the Glance
    v1 API allow the illegal modification of image status. Setups
    which also use the v2 API may allow a subsequent re-upload of
    image contents.'
