title: Account name and UUID oracles in account locking

description: >
  Samuel de Medeiros Queiroz with Oi Cloud reported a vulnerability affecting
  Keystone account locking. By guessing the name of an account and failing to
  authenticate multiple times, any unauthenticated actor could both confirm the
  account exists and obtain that account's corresponding UUID, which might be
  leveraged for other unrelated attacks. All Keystone deployments enabling
  security_compliance.lockout_failure_attempts are affected.
