title: Raw underlying encrypted volume access

description: >
  Lee Yarwood (Red Hat) reported a vulnerability in Nova encrypted
  volumes handling. By detaching and reattaching an encrypted volume
  an attacker may access the underlying raw volume and corrupt the
  LUKS header resuling in a denial of service attack on the compute host.
  All Nova setups supporting encrypted volumes are affected.
