title: 'Potential reuse of revoked Identity tokens'

description: 'Liu Sheng reported a vulnerability in Keystone. By manipulating a token
    content, an authenticated user may prevent its revocation. This can allow
    unauthorized access to cloud resources if a revoked token is
    intercepted by an attacker. Only keystone setups using PKI or PKIZ token
    are affected'
