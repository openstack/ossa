title: 'Admin-only network attributes may be reset to defaults by non-privileged users'

description: 'Elena Ezhova from Mirantis reported a vulnerability in Neutron.
  By updating a network attribute with a default value a non-privileged
  user may reset admin-only network attributes. This may lead to unexpected
  behavior with security implications for operators with a custom policy.json,
  or in some extreme cases network outages resulting in denial of service.
  All deployments using neutron networking are affected by this flaw.'
