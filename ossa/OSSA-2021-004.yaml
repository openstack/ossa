title: Linuxbridge ARP filter bypass on Netfilter platforms

description: >
  Jake Yip with ARDC and Justin Mammarella with the University of Melbourne
  reported a vulnerability in Neutron's linuxbridge driver on newer
  Netfilter-based platforms (the successor to IPTables). By sending carefully
  crafted packets, anyone in control of a server instance connected to the
  virtual switch can impersonate the hardware addresses of other systems on the
  network, resulting in denial of service or in some cases possibly
  interception of traffic intended for other destinations. Only deployments
  using the linuxbridge driver with ebtables-nft are affected.
