title: 'Potential leak of passwords into log files'

description: "Amrith Kumar from Tesora reported two vulnerabilities in the
  processutils.execute() and strutils.mask_password() functions available
  from oslo-incubator that are copied into each project's code. An
  attacker with read access to the services' logs may obtain passwords
  used as a parameter of a command that has failed (CVE-2014-7230) or when
  mask_password did not mask passwords properly (CVE-2014-7231). All
  Cinder, Nova and Trove setups are affected."
