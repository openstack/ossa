title: Overlapping security group rules prevents compute node network configuration

description: >
  Diko Parvanov (Canonical) reported a vulnerability in
  neutron-openvswitch-agent security group rules. By creating
  two security groups with separate/overlapping port ranges, an
  authenticated user may prevent neutron from being able to configure
  networks on any compute nodes where those security groups are
  present. All neutron deployments utilizing
  neutron-openvswitch-agent are affected.
