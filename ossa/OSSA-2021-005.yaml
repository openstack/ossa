title: Arbitrary dnsmasq reconfiguration via extra_dhcp_opts

description: >
  Pavel Toporkov reported a vulnerability in Neutron. By supplying a specially
  crafted extra_dhcp_opts value, an authenticated user may add arbitrary
  configuration to the dnsmasq process in order to crash the service, change
  parameters for other tenants sharing the same interface, or otherwise alter
  that daemon's behavior. This vulnerability may also be used to trigger a
  configuration parsing buffer overflow in versions of dnsmasq prior to 2.81,
  which could lead to remote code execution. All Neutron deployments are
  affected.
