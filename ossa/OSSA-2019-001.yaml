title: Unsupported dport option prevents applying security groups

description: >
  Erik Olof Gunnar Andersson with Blizzard Entertainment reported a
  vulnerability in Neutron's iptables firewall module. By setting a
  destination port in a security group rule along with a protocol
  which doesn't support that option (for example, VRRP), an
  authenticated user may block further application of security group
  rules for instances from any project/tenant on the compute hosts
  to which it's applied. Only deployments using the iptables
  security group driver are affected.
