title: 'S3Token TLS cert verification option not honored'

description: 'Brant Knudson from IBM reported a vulnerability in keystonemiddleware
    (formerly shipped as python-keystoneclient). When the ''insecure'' option is
    set in a S3Token paste configuration file its value is effectively ignored
    and instead assumed to be true. As a result certificate verification will be
    disabled, leaving TLS connections open to MITM attacks. Note that it''s
    unusual to explicitly add this option and then set it to false, so the impact
    of this bug is thought to be limited. All versions of s3_token middleware
    with TLS settings configured are affected by this flaw.'
