title: 'Neutron security groups bypass through invalid CIDR'

description: 'Stephen Ma from Hewlett Packard and Christoph Thiel from Deutsche Telekom
  reported a vulnerability in Neutron security groups. By creating a security group
  rule with an invalid CIDR, an authenticated user may break openvswitch-agent process,

  preventing further rules from being applied on the host. Note: removal of the faulty
  rule is not enough, the openvswitch-agent must be restarted. All Neutron setups
  using Open vSwitch are affected.'
