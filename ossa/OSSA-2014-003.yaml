title: 'Live migration can leak root disk into ephemeral storage'

description: 'Loganathan Parthipan from Hewlett Packard reported a vulnerability in
  the Nova libvirt driver. By spawning a server with the same flavor as another user''s
  migrated virtual machine, an authenticated user can potentially access that user''s
  snapshot content resulting in information leakage. Only setups using KVM live block
  migration are affected.'
