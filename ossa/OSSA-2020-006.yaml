title: Live migration fails to update persistent domain XML

description: >
  Tadayoshi Hosoya (NEC) and Lee Yarwood (Red Hat) reported a
  vulnerability in Nova live migration. By performing a soft reboot of
  an instance which has previously undergone live migration, a user
  may gain access to destination host devices that share the same
  paths as host devices previously referenced by the virtual machine
  on the source. This can include block devices that map to different
  Cinder volumes on the destination than the source. The risk is
  increased significantly in non-default configurations allowing
  untrusted users to initiate live migrations, so administrators may
  consider temporarily disabling this in policy if they cannot upgrade
  immediately. This only impacts deployments where users are allowed
  to perform soft reboots of server instances; it is recommended to
  disable soft reboots in policy (only allowing hard reboots) until
  the fix can be applied.
