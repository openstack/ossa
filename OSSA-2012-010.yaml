title: 'Various Keystone token expiration issues'

description: 'Derek Higgins reported various issues affecting Keystone token expiration.
  A token expiration date can be circumvented by continuously creating new tokens
  before the old one has expired. Existing tokens also remain valid after a user account
  is disabled or after an account password changed. An authenticated and authorized
  user could potentially leverage those vulnerabilities to extend his access beyond
  the account owner expectations.'
