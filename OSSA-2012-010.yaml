advisory-title: 'Various Keystone token expiration issues'

advisory-description: 'Derek Higgins reported various issues affecting Keystone token
  expiration. A token expiration date can be circumvented by continuously creating
  new tokens before the old one has expired. Existing tokens also remain valid after
  a user account is disabled or after an account password changed. An authenticated
  and authorized user could potentially leverage those vulnerabilities to extend his
  access beyond the account owner expectations.'
