title: 'Missing SSL certificate check in Python Swift client'

description: 'Thomas Leaman from HP reported that the Python Swift client was failing
  to properly check certificates during the establishment of HTTPS connections. A
  remote attacker with access over segments of the network between client and server
  could potentially set up a man-in-the-middle attack and access the contents of the
  Swift client''s communication with the server, including any used credentials.'
