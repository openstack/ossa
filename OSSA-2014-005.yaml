advisory-title: 'Missing SSL certificate check in Python Swift client'

advisory-description: 'Thomas Leaman from HP reported that the Python Swift client
  was failing to properly check certificates during the establishment of HTTPS connections.
  A remote attacker with access over segments of the network between client and server
  could potentially set up a man-in-the-middle attack and access the contents of the
  Swift client''s communication with the server, including any used credentials.'
