title: 'RBAC policy not properly enforced in Nova EC2 API'

description: 'Marc Heckmann from Ubisoft reported a vulnerability in the Nova EC2
  API security group implementation. RBAC policies are not enforced when using the
  EC2 API, in particular the add_rules, remove_rules and destroy methods. A restricted
  user may overcome his limitation by using EC2 API resulting in unauthorized action
  on security groups. Only setups using non-default RBAC rules for Nova may be affected.'
