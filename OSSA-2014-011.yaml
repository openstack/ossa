advisory-title: 'RBAC policy not properly enforced in Nova EC2 API'

advisory-description: 'Marc Heckmann from Ubisoft reported a vulnerability in the
  Nova EC2 API security group implementation. RBAC policies are not enforced when
  using the EC2 API, in particular the add_rules, remove_rules and destroy methods.
  A restricted user may overcome his limitation by using EC2 API resulting in unauthorized
  action on security groups. Only setups using non-default RBAC rules for Nova may
  be affected.'
