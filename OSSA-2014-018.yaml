advisory-title: 'Keystone privilege escalation through trust chained delegation'

advisory-description: 'Steven Hardy from Red Hat reported a vulnerability in Keystone
  chained delegation. By creating a delegation from a trust or OAuth token, a trustee
  may abuse the identity impersonation against keystone and circumvent the enforced
  scope, resulting in potential elevated privileges to any of the trustor''s projects
  and or roles. All Keystone deployments configured to enable trusts are affected,
  which has been the default since Grizzly.'
