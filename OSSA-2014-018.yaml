title: 'Keystone privilege escalation through trust chained delegation'

description: 'Steven Hardy from Red Hat reported a vulnerability in Keystone chained
  delegation. By creating a delegation from a trust or OAuth token, a trustee may
  abuse the identity impersonation against keystone and circumvent the enforced scope,
  resulting in potential elevated privileges to any of the trustor''s projects and
  or roles. All Keystone deployments configured to enable trusts are affected, which
  has been the default since Grizzly.'
