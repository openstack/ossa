title: 'Keystone DoS through V3 API authentication chaining'

description: 'Abu Shohel Ahmed from Ericsson reported a vulnerability in Keystone
  V3 API authentication. By sending a single request with the same authentication
  method multiple times, a remote attacker may generate unwanted load on the Keystone
  host, potentially resulting in a Denial of Service against a Keystone service. Only
  Keystone setups enabling V3 API are affected.'
