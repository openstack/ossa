title: 'Nova VMware driver still leaks  rescued images'

description: 'Garth Mollett from Red Hat reported an incomplete fix
  to OSSA-2014-017 (CVE-2014-2573), a vulnerability affecting Nova.
  If an authenticated user places an instance into rescue, and then
  issues a suspend command it will cause the instance to enter an
  ERROR state. Nova does not clean up an instance in this state
  correctly upon deletion. An attacker can use this to launch a
  denial of service attack. Only setups using the Nova VMware
  driver are affected by this flaw.'
