advisory-title: 'Nova DoS by allocating all Fixed IPs'

advisory-description: 'Vish Ishaya reported a vulnerability in Nova where there is
  no quota for Fixed IPs. Previously the instance quota acted as a proxy for a Fixed
  IP quota, but if your configuration allows an instance to consume more than one
  Fixed IP via an extension such as multinic then this is no longer true. Running
  out of Fixed IPs would result in not being able to spawn new instances.'
