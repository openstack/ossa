title: 'Nova DoS by allocating all Fixed IPs'

description: 'Vish Ishaya reported a vulnerability in Nova where there is no quota
  for Fixed IPs. Previously the instance quota acted as a proxy for a Fixed IP quota,
  but if your configuration allows an instance to consume more than one Fixed IP via
  an extension such as multinic then this is no longer true. Running out of Fixed
  IPs would result in not being able to spawn new instances.'
