advisory-title: 'Arbitrary file injection/corruption through directory traversal'

advisory-description: 'Matthias Weckbecker from SUSE Security team reported a vulnerability
  in Nova compute nodes handling of file injection in disk images. By requesting iles
  to be injected in malicious paths, a remote authenticated user could inject files
  in arbitrary locations on the host file system, potentially resulting in full compromise
  of the compute node. Only Essex and later setups running the OpenStack API over
  libvirt-based hypervisors are affected. Upon further inspection of the code, Pádraig
  Brady from Red Hat found an additional vulnerability. By crafting a malicious image
  and requesting an instance based on it, a remote authenticated user may corrupt
  arbitrary files on the host filesystem, potentially resulting in a denial of service.
  This affects all setups. '
