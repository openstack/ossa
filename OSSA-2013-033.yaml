title: 'Metadata queries from Neutron to Nova are not restricted by tenant'

description: 'Aaron Rosen from VMware reported a vulnerability in the metadata access
  from OpenStack Neutron to Nova. Because of a missing authorization check on port
  binding, by guessing an instance_id a tenant may retrieve another tenant''s metadata
  resulting in information disclosure. Only OpenStack setups running neutron-metadata-agent
  are affected. '
