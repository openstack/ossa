        "description": "Derek Higgins reported various issues affecting Keystone token expiration. A token expiration date can be circumvented by continuously creating new tokens before the old one has expired. Existing tokens also remain valid after a user account is disabled or after an account password changed. An authenticated and authorized user could potentially leverage those vulnerabilities to extend his access beyond the account owner expectations.",
