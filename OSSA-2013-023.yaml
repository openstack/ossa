advisory-title: 'Denial of Service using XML entities in Nova/Cinder extensions'

advisory-description: 'Grant Murphy from Red Hat reported that vulnerabilities in
  XML request parsers were not fully patched in OSSA 2013-004. By leveraging XML entity
  expansion in specific extensions, an unauthenticated attacker may still consume
  excessive resources on the Nova (CVE-2013-4179) or Cinder (CVE-2013-4202) API servers,
  resulting in a denial of service and potentially a crash. Only Nova setups making
  use of the security group extension in Grizzly are affected. Only Cinder setups
  making use of the backups or volume transfer API extension in Grizzly are affected.'
