title: 'Issues in Keystone middleware memcache signing/encryption feature'

description: 'Paul McMillan from Nebula reported multiple issues in the implementation
  of memcache signing/encryption feature in Keystone client middleware. An attacker
  with direct write access to the memcache backend (or in a man-in-the-middle position)
  could insert malicious data and potentially bypass the encryption (CVE-2013-2166)
  or signing (CVE-2013-2167) security strategy that was specified. Only setups that
  make use of memcache caching in the Keystone middleware (specify memcache_servers)
  and using ENCRYPT or MAC as their memcache_security_strategy are affected.'
