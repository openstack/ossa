title: 'Extension of token validity through token chaining'

description: 'Anndy reported a vulnerability in token chaining in Keystone. A token
  expiration date can be circumvented by creating a new token before the old one has
  expired. An authenticated and authorized user could potentially leverage this vulnerability

  to extend his access beyond the account owner expectations. Note: this vulnerability
  was fixed in the past (CVE-2012-3426) but was reintroduced in Folsom when code was
  refactored to support PKI tokens.'
