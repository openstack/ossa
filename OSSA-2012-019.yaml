advisory-title: 'Extension of token validity through token chaining'

advisory-description: 'Anndy reported a vulnerability in token chaining in Keystone.
  A token expiration date can be circumvented by creating a new token before the old
  one has expired. An authenticated and authorized user could potentially leverage
  this vulnerability to extend his access beyond the account owner expectations. Note:
  this vulnerability was fixed in the past (CVE-2012-3426) but was reintroduced in
  Folsom when code was refactored to support PKI tokens.'
