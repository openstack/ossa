advisory-title: 'EC2-style credentials invalidation issue'

advisory-description: 'Vijaya Erukala reported a vulnerability in Keystone EC2-style
  credentials invalidation: when a user is removed from a tenant, issued EC2-style
  credentials would continue to be valid for that tenant. An authenticated and authorized
  user could potentially leverage this vulnerability to extend his access beyond the
  account owner expectations. Only setups enabling EC2-style credentials (for example
  enabling EC2 API in Nova) are affected.'
