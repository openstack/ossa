title: 'EC2-style credentials invalidation issue'

description: 'Vijaya Erukala reported a vulnerability in Keystone EC2-style credentials

  invalidation: when a user is removed from a tenant, issued EC2-style credentials
  would continue to be valid for that tenant. An authenticated and authorized user
  could potentially leverage this vulnerability to extend his access beyond the account
  owner expectations. Only setups enabling EC2-style credentials (for example enabling
  EC2 API in Nova) are affected.'
