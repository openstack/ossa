title: 'Scheduler denial of service through scheduler_hints'

description: 'Dan Prince from Red Hat reported a vulnerability in Nova scheduler nodes.
  By creating servers with malicious scheduler_hints, an authenticated user may generate
  a huge amount of database calls, potentially resulting in a Denial of Service attack
  against Nova scheduler nodes. Only setups exposing the OpenStack API and enabling
  DifferentHostFilter and/or SameHostFilter are affected. '
