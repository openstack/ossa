title: 'Ceilometer DB2/MongoDB backend password leak'

description: 'Eric Brown from IBM reported an information leak in Ceilometer logs.
  The password for the DB2 or MongoDB backends was logged at INFO level in the ceilometer-api
  logs. An attacker with access to the logs (local shell, log aggregation system access,
  or accidental leak) may leverage this vulnerability to elevate privileges and gain
  direct full access to the Ceilometer backend. Only Ceilometer setups using the DB2
  or MongoDB backends are affected.'
