        "description": "Dolph Mathews reported a vulnerability in Keystone. When attempting to update a user's default tenant, Keystone will only partially deny the request when a user is not authorized to complete  this action. The API responds with 401 Not Authorized and the user's default tenant is not changed. However, the user is still granted membership to this new tenant.The result is that any client  that can reach the administrative API (deployed on port 35357, by default) can add any user to any tenant.",
