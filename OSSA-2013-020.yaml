advisory-title: 'Denial of Service in Nova network source security groups'

advisory-description: 'Vishvananda Ishaya from Nebula reported a denial of service
  vulnerability in Nova''s handling of network source security group policy updates.
  By performing a large number of server creation operations, the proportion of updates
  increases quadratically and may overwhelm nova-network such that it is no longer
  able to service other requests in a timely fashion. Only setups relying on nova-network
  are affected.'
