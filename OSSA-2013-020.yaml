title: 'Denial of Service in Nova network source security groups'

description: 'Vishvananda Ishaya from Nebula reported a denial of service vulnerability
  in Nova''s handling of network source security group policy updates. By performing
  a large number of server creation operations, the proportion of updates increases
  quadratically and may overwhelm nova-network such that it is no longer able to service
  other requests in a timely fashion. Only setups relying on nova-network are affected.'
