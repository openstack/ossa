advisory-title: 'VNC proxy can connect to the wrong VM'

advisory-description: 'Loganathan Parthipan (HP) and Rohit Karajgi (NTT Data) independently
  reported a vulnerability in Nova. If a user requests a console and then deletes
  the VM, it is possible that the console token could allow connectivity to a different
  VM before the console token expires if the VNC port gets reused in that time period.
  This issue can be worked around by disabling VNC support. '
