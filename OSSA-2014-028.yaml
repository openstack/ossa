title: 'Glance store DoS through disk space exhaustion'

description: 'Thomas Leaman and Stuart McLaren from Hewlett Packard reported a vulnerability
  in Glance. By uploading a large enough image to a Glance store, an authenticated
  user may fill the store space because the image_size_cap configuration option is
  not honored. This may prevent further image upload and/or cause service disruption.
  Note that the import method is not affected. All Glance setups using API v2 are
  affected (unless you use a policy to restrict/disable image upload).'
