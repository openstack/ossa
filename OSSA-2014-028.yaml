advisory-title: 'Glance store DoS through disk space exhaustion'

advisory-description: 'Thomas Leaman and Stuart McLaren from Hewlett Packard reported
  a vulnerability in Glance. By uploading a large enough image to a Glance store,
  an authenticated user may fill the store space because the image_size_cap configuration
  option is not honored. This may prevent further image upload and/or cause service
  disruption. Note that the import method is not affected. All Glance setups using
  API v2 are affected (unless you use a policy to restrict/disable image upload).'
