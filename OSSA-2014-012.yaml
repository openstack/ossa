advisory-title: 'Remote code execution in Glance Sheepdog backend'

advisory-description: 'Paul McMillan from Nebula reported a vulnerability in Glance
  Sheepdog backend. By using a specially crafted location, a user allowed to insert
  or modify Glance image metadata may trigger code execution on the Glance host as
  the user the Glance service runs under. This may result in Glance host unauthorized
  access and further compromise of the Glance service. All setups using Glance server
  with the (enabled by default) sheepdog backend are affected.'
