description: 'Nachi Ueno (NTT PF lab), Rohit Karajgi (Vertex) and Venkatesan Ravikumar
  (HP) discovered a vulnerability in Nova API nodes handling of incoming requests.
  An authenticated user may craft malicious commands to affect resources on tenants

  or compromise of computing resources created by a third-party. Only setups allowing
  the OpenStack API are affected.     '
