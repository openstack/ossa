        "description": "The IBM OpenStack test team reported a vulnerability in role change code within the Keystone LDAP backend. When a role on a tenant is removed from a user, and that user doesn't have that role on the tenant, then the user may actually be granted the role on the tenant. A user could use social engineering and leverage that vulnerability to get extra roles granted, or may accidentally be granted extra roles. Only Keystone setups using a LDAP backend are affected.",
