advisory-title: 'Swift TempURL timing attack'

advisory-description: 'Samuel Merritt from SwiftStack reported a timing attack vulnerability
  in Swift TempURL middleware. By analyzing response times to arbitrary TempURL requests,
  an attacker may be able to guess valid secret URLs and get access to objects that
  were only intended to be publicly shared with specific recipients. In order to use
  this attack, the attacker needs to know the targeted object name, and the object
  account needs to have a TempURL key set. Only Swift setups enabling the TempURL
  middleware are affected.'
