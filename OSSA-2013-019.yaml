title: 'Resource limit circumvention in Nova private flavors'

description: 'hzrandd from NetEase reported a resource limit circumvention vulnerability
  in Nova''s handling of private flavors. Any tenant is able to show and boot any
  other tenant''s private flavors by guessing a flavor ID. This not only exposes the
  flavor''s name, memory and disk size, swap allocation, VCPU count and similar flavor
  properties, but potentially allows circumvention of any resource limits enforced

  through the os-flavor-access:is_public property.'
