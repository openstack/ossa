advisory-title: 'Keystone PKI tokens online validation bypasses revocation check'

advisory-description: 'Guang Yee from HP reported a vulnerability in the revocation
  check for Keystone PKI tokens. Those tokens are supposed to be validated locally
  using cryptographic checks, but the user also has the option of asking the server
  to validate them. In that case, the online verification of PKI tokens would bypass
  the revocation check, potentially affirming revocated tokens are still valid. Only
  Folsom setups making use of online verification of PKI tokens are affected.'
