title: 'No quota enforced on security group rules'

description: 'Dan Prince reported a vulnerability in Nova. He discovered that there
  was no limit on the number of security group rules a user can create. By creating
  a very large set of rules, an unreasonable number of iptables rules will be created
  on compute nodes, resulting in a denial of service. '
