advisory-title: 'Nova compute DoS through ephemeral disk backing files'

advisory-description: 'Phil Day from HP reported a vulnerability in the libvirt driver
  handling of ephemeral disk backing files on Nova compute nodes. By repeatedly creating
  snapshots, changing the os_type to a new random value, and spawning new instances
  from the snapshot (and quickly deleting those instances), an authenticated user
  could generate lots of different ephemeral disk backing files and fill up compute
  node disks, potentially resulting in a Denial of Service against a Nova setup. Only
  Nova setups running the libvirt driver are affected.'
