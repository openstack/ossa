advisory-title: 'EC2-style authentication accepts disabled user/tenants'

advisory-description: 'Nathanael Burton reported a vulnerability in EC2-style authentication
  in Keystone. Keystone fails to check whether a user, tenant, or domain is enabled  before
  authenticating a user using the EC2 api. Authenticated, but disabled users (or authenticated
  users in disabled tenants or domains) could therefore retain access rights that
  were thought removed. Only setups enabling EC2-style authentication are affected.
  To disable EC2-style authentication to work around the issue, remove the EC2 extension
  (keystone.contrib.ec2:Ec2Extension.factory) from the keystone API pipeline in keystone.conf. '
