advisory-title: 'Potential denial of service on Nova when using Qpid'

advisory-description: 'Jaroslav Henner from Red Hat reported a vulnerability in Nova
  when using Apache Qpid as the RPC backend. By sending any random text longer than
  65K characters to an instance console and requesting the console log contents through
  the API, an authenticated user may disrupt the nova-compute node his instance is
  running on. This vulnerability could be leveraged in a Denial of Service attack
  against the cloud provider. Only Folsom and Grizzly setups using Qpid as their RPC
  backend are affected. Havana setups, or setups using other RPC backends (like RabbitMQ),
  are all unaffected.'
