advisory-title: 'Glance image_download policy not enforced for cached images'

advisory-description: 'Stuart McLaren from HP reported a vulnerability in Glance download_image
  policy enforcement in the case of cached images. Deployers may opt to set a download_image
  policy to restrict image download to specific roles. However, when an image is previously
  cached by an authorized download, any authenticated user could download image contents
  if it can determine the image UUID, bypassing any download_image policy restrictions.
  This could result in disclosure of image contents that were thought to be protected
  by the download_image policy setting. Only setups making use of the download_image
  policy are affected.'
