title: 'Extremely long passwords can crash Keystone'

description: 'Dan Prince reported a vulnerability in Keystone. He discovered that
  you can remotely trigger a crash in Keystone by sending an extremely long password.
  When Keystone is validating the password, glibc allocates space on the stack for
  the entire password. If the password is long enough, stack space can be exhausted,
  resulting in a crash. This vulnerability is mitigated by a patch to impose a reasonablelimit
  on password length (4 kB).'
