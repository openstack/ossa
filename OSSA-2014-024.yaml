advisory-title: 'Use of non-constant time comparison operation'

advisory-description: 'Alex Gaynor from Rackspace reported a timing attack vulnerability
  in Nova.   By analyzing response times to requests for instance metadata, an attacker  may
  be able to guess a valid instance ID signature. This could allow access  to important
  configuration details of another instance. Only setups  configured to proxy metadata
  requests via Neutron are affected.'
