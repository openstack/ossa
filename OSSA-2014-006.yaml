title: 'Trustee token revocation does not work with memcache backend'

description: 'Morgan Fainberg from Metacloud reported a vulnerability in the Keystone
  memcache token backend. When a trustor issues a trust token with impersonation enabled,
  the token is only added to the trustor''s token list and not to the trustee''s token
  list. This results in the trust token not being invalidated by the trustee''s token
  revocation (bulk revocation). This is most noticeable when the trustee user is disabled
  or the trustee changes a password. Only setups using the memcache backend for tokens
  in Keystone are affected.'
