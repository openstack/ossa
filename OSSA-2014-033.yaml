title: 'Cinder-volume host data leak to vm instance'

description: 'Duncan Thomas from Hewlett Packard reported a vulnerability in Cinder
  GlusterFS and Linux Smbfs drivers. By overwriting a volume from within
  an instance with a malicious qcow2 header, an authenticated user may be
  able to clone and attach that corrupted volume resulting in affected
  drivers leaking an arbitrary file from the Cinder-volume host to the
  virtual instance. Note that the host file must be readable by the Cinder
  context to be exposed. Only Cinder setups using GlusterFS volume driver
  configured with glusterfs_qcow2_volumes=False (which is the default) or
  Cinder setups using Smbfs volume driver configured with
  smbfs_default_volume_format=raw (which is not the default) are affected.'
