advisory-title: 'Neutron security groups bypass through invalid CIDR'

advisory-description: 'Stephen Ma from Hewlett Packard and Christoph Thiel from Deutsche
  Telekom reported a vulnerability in Neutron security groups. By creating a security
  group rule with an invalid CIDR, an authenticated user may break openvswitch-agent
  process, preventing further rules from being applied on the host. Note: removal
  of the faulty rule is not enough, the openvswitch-agent must be restarted. All Neutron
  setups using Open vSwitch are affected.'
