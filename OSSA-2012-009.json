By creating servers with malicious scheduler_hints, an authenticated user may generate a huge amount of database calls, potentially resulting in a Denial of Service attack against Nova scheduler nodes. Only setups exposing the OpenStack API and enabling DifferentHostFilter and/or SameHostFilter are affected. ",
