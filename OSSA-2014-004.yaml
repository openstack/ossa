advisory-title: 'Glance Swift store backend password leak'

advisory-description: 'Nikhil Komawar from Rackspace reported an information leak
  in Glance logs. The password for the Swift store backend is logged at WARNING level
  as part of the URL when authentication to a store fails if image location is not
  disabled by policy or the store is a single-tenant configuration. An attacker with
  access to the logs (local shell, log aggregation system access, or accidental leak)
  may leverage this vulnerability to elevate privileges and gain direct full access
  to the Glance Swift store backend. Only Glance setups using the Swift store backend
  are affected.'
