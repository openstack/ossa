advisory-title: 'Keystone tokens not immediately invalidated when user is deleted'

advisory-description: 'Sam Stoelinga reported a vulnerability in Keystone. When users
  are deleted through Keystone v2 API, existing tokens for those users are not immediately
  invalidated and remain valid for the duration of the token''s life (by default,
  up to 24 hours). This may result in users retaining access when the administrator
  of the system thought them disabled. You can workaround this issue by disabling
  a user before deleting it: in that case the tokens belonging to the disabled user
  are immediately invalidated. Keystone setups using the v3 API call to delete users
  are unaffected.'
