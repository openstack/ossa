        "description": "Thomas Leaman and Stuart McLaren from Hewlett Packard reported a vulnerability in Glance. By uploading a large enough image to a Glance store, an authenticated user may fill the store space because the image_size_cap configuration option is not honored. This may prevent further image upload and/or cause service disruption. Note that the import method is not affected. All Glance setups using API v2 are affected (unless you use a policy to restrict/disable image upload).",
