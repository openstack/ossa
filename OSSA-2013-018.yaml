title: 'Missing SSL certificate check in Python glance client'

description: 'Thomas Leaman from HP reported that the Python Glance client was failing
  to properly check certificates during the establishment of HTTPS connections. A
  remote attacker with access over segments of the network between client and server
  could potentially set up a man-in the-middle attack and access the contents of the
  Glance client request (or response).'
