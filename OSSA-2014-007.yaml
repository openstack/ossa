title: 'Potential context confusion in Keystone middleware'

description: 'Kieran Spear from the University of Melbourne reported a vulnerability
  in Keystone auth_token middleware (shipped in python-keystoneclient). By doing repeated
  requests, with sufficient load on the target system, an authenticated user may in
  certain situations assume another authenticated user''s complete identity and multi-tenant
  authorizations, potentially resulting in a privilege escalation. Note that it is
  related to a bad interaction between eventlet and python-memcached that should be
  avoided if the calling process already monkey-patches "thread" to use eventlet.
  Only keystone middleware setups using auth_token with memcache are vulnerable.'
