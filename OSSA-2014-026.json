        "description" : "Lance Bragstad from Rackspace and Brant Knudson from IBM reported 3 vulnerabilities in Keystone revocation events. Lance Bragstad discovered that UUID v2 tokens processed by the V3 API are incorrectly updated and get their \"issued_at\" time regenerated (CVE-2014-5252). Brant Knudson discovered that the MySQL token driver stores expiration dates incorrectly which prevents manual revocation (CVE-2014-5251) and that domain-scoped tokens don't get revoked when the domain is disabled (CVE-2014-5253). Tokens impacted by one of these bugs may allow a user to evade token revocation. Only Keystone setups configured to use revocation events are affected.",
