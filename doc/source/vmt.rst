 Vulnerability Management Team
===============================

An autonomous subgroup of vulnerability management specialists with in the
security team make up the OpenStack vulnerability management team (VMT).
Their job is facilitating the reporting of vulnerabilities, coordinating
security fixes and handling progressive disclosure of the vulnerability
information. Specifically, they are responsible for the following functions:

* Vulnerability Management: All vulnerabilities discovered by community
  members (or users) can be reported to the Team.

* Vulnerability Tracking: The Team will curate a set of vulnerability related
  issues in the issue tracker. Some of these issues will be private to the
  Team and the affected product leads, but once remediated, all vulnerabilities
  will be public.

* Coordinated Disclosure: As part of our commitment to work with the security
  community, the Team will ensure that proper credit is given to security
  researchers who report issues in OpenStack.
