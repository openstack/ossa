advisory-title: 'Compute node filesystem injection/corruption'

advisory-description: 'Pádraig Brady from Red Hat discovered that the fix implemented
  for CVE-2012-3361 (OSSA-2012-008) was not covering all attack scenarios. By crafting
  a malicious image with root-readable-only symlinks and requesting a server based
  on it, an authenticated user could still corrupt arbitrary files (all setups affected)
  or inject arbitrary files (Essex and later setups with OpenStack API enabled and
  a libvirt-based hypervisor) on the host filesystem, potentially resulting in full
  compromise of that compute node.'
