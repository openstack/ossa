title: 'Compute node filesystem injection/corruption'

description: 'Pádraig Brady from Red Hat discovered that the fix implemented for CVE-2012-3361
  (OSSA-2012-008) was not covering all attack scenarios. By crafting a malicious image
  with root-readable-only symlinks and requesting a server based on it, an authenticated
  user could still corrupt arbitrary files (all setups affected) or inject arbitrary
  files (Essex and later setups with OpenStack API enabled and a libvirt-based hypervisor)
  on the host filesystem, potentially resulting in full compromise of that compute
  node.'
