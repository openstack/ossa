title: 'Routers can be cross plugged by other tenants'

description: 'Aaron Rosen from VMware reported a vulnerability where Neutron fails
  to perform proper authorization checks when creating ports. By choosing a device
  id of a router from a different tenant when creating a port, an authenticated user
  can access the network of other tenants. This affects deployments of Neutron using
  plugins relying on the l3-agent.'
