advisory-title: 'Routers can be cross plugged by other tenants'

advisory-description: 'Aaron Rosen from VMware reported a vulnerability where Neutron
  fails to perform proper authorization checks when creating ports. By choosing a
  device id of a router from a different tenant when creating a port, an authenticated
  user can access the network of other tenants. This affects deployments of Neutron
  using plugins relying on the l3-agent.'
