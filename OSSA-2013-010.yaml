advisory-title: 'Nova uses insecure keystone middleware tmpdir by default'

advisory-description: 'Grant Murphy from Red Hat and Anton Lundin both independently
  reported a vulnerability in Nova''s default location for the Keystone middleware
  signing directory (signing_dir). By previously setting up a malicious directory
  structure, an attacker with local shell access on the Nova node could potentially
  issue forged tokens that would be accepted by the middleware. Only setups that use
  the default value for signing_dir are affected. Note that future versions of the
  Keystone middleware will issue a warning if an insecure signing directory is used. '
