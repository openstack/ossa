title: 'Nova uses insecure keystone middleware tmpdir by default'

description: 'Grant Murphy from Red Hat and Anton Lundin both independently reported
  a vulnerability in Nova''s default location for the Keystone middleware signing
  directory (signing_dir). By previously setting up a malicious directory structure,
  an attacker with local shell access on the Nova node could potentially issue forged
  tokens that would be accepted by the middleware. Only setups that use the default
  value for signing_dir are affected. Note that future versions of the Keystone middleware
  will issue a warning if an insecure signing directory is used. '
