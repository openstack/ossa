title: 'Swift metadata constraints are not correctly enforced'

description: 'Rajaneesh Singh reported a vulnerability in the way Swift enforces
  metadata constraints. By adding metadata in several separate calls, an
  authenticated attacker can bypass the max_meta_count constraint,
  potentially resulting in the storage of more metadata than allowed in
  configuration.'
