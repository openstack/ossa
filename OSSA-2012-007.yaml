title: 'Security groups fail to be set correctly'

description: 'HP Cloud Services reported a vulnerability in Nova API handling. When
  a security group is created via the EC2 or OS API''s that uses a protocol defined
  in the incorrect case i.e ''TCP'' rather than ''tcp'' it causes a later string comparison
  to fail. This leads to Security Groups not being set correctly. Once he ova DB has
  been polluted with the incorrect case any subsequent modifications to the security
  group will also fail. ake Nova resilient to any protocol case inconsistencies that
  may be in the Nova DB. Users may want to consider sanitizing their database by forcing
  all protocol entries to lower case, hardening their DB against any failures of future
  code that may expect the data to be lower case. '
