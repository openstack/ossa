advisory-title: 'Resource limit circumvention in Nova private flavors'

advisory-description: 'Ken''ichi Ohmichi from NEC reported that the fix for OSSA 2013-019
  (CVE-2013-2256) was incomplete. Any tenant was still able to boot any other tenant''s
  private flavors by guessing a flavor ID. This potentially allowed circumvention
  of any resource limits enforced through the os-flavor-access:is_public property.'
