title: 'Resource limit circumvention in Nova private flavors'

description: 'Ken''ichi Ohmichi from NEC reported that the fix for OSSA 2013-019 (CVE-2013-2256)
  was incomplete. Any tenant was still able to boot any other tenant''s private flavors
  by guessing a flavor ID. This potentially allowed circumvention of any resource

  limits enforced through the os-flavor-access:is_public property.'
