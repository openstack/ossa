advisory-title: 'Missing expiration check in Keystone PKI tokens validation'

advisory-description: 'Eoghan Glynn from Red Hat and Alex Meade from Rackspace both
  reported a vulnerability in expiry checks for PKI tokens in the Keystone authentication
  middleware. Expired tokens for authenticated users could continue to be used, potentially
  resulting in the bypass of intended security policies. The effect of PKI token revocation
  is also reversed when the token expires, in the sense that a revoked token is once
  again treated as being valid. Only setups using PKI tokens are affected.'
