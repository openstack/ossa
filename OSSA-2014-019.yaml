advisory-title: 'Neutron L3-agent DoS through IPv6 subnet'

advisory-description: 'Thiago Martins from Hewlett Packard reported a vulnerability
  in Neutron L3-agent. By creating an IPv6 private subnet attached to a L3 router,
  an authenticated user may break the L3-agent, preventing further floating IPv4 addresses
  from being attached for the entire cloud. Note: removal of the faulty network can
  not be done using the API and must be cleaned at the database level. Only Neutron
  setups using IPv6 and L3-agent are affected.'
