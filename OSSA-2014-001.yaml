title: 'Nova live snapshots use an insecure local directory'

description: 'Daniel Berrange from Red Hat reported that the directories used to temporarily
  store live snapshots on Nova compute nodes were writable to all local users. A local
  attacker with shell access on compute nodes could therefore read and modify the
  contents of live snapshots before those are uploaded to the image service.'
