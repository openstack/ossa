advisory-title: 'Nova live snapshots use an insecure local directory'

advisory-description: 'Daniel Berrange from Red Hat reported that the directories
  used to temporarily store live snapshots on Nova compute nodes were writable to
  all local users. A local attacker with shell access on compute nodes could therefore
  read and modify the contents of live snapshots before those are uploaded to the
  image service.'
