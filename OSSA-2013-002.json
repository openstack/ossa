By creating an image in Glance by URL that references a mis-configured Swift endpoint, or if the Swift endpoint that a previously-ACTIVE image references for any reason becomes unusable, an authenticated user may access the  Glance operator's Swift credentials for that endpoint. Only setups that use the single-tenant Swift store are affected. ",
