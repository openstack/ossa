title: 'XSS in Horizon orchestration dashboard'

description: 'Cristian Fiorentino from Intel reported a vulnerability in Horizon Orchestration
  dashboard. By tricking a Horizon user into using a malicious template in the Orchestration/Stack
  section of Horizon, a remote attacker may trigger a cross-site-scripting vulnerability.
  It may result in potential assets theft (Horizon user/admin access credentials,
  tenants confidential information, etc.). Only setups exposing the orchestration
  dashboard in Horizon are affected. '
