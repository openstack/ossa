advisory-title: 'XSS in Horizon orchestration dashboard'

advisory-description: 'Cristian Fiorentino from Intel reported a vulnerability in
  Horizon Orchestration dashboard. By tricking a Horizon user into using a malicious
  template in the Orchestration/Stack section of Horizon, a remote attacker may trigger
  a cross-site-scripting vulnerability. It may result in potential assets theft (Horizon
  user/admin access credentials, tenants confidential information, etc.). Only setups
  exposing the orchestration dashboard in Horizon are affected. '
