advisory-title: 'Multiple vulnerabilities in Keystone revocation events'

advisory-description: 'Lance Bragstad from Rackspace and Brant Knudson from IBM reported
  3 vulnerabilities in Keystone revocation events. Lance Bragstad discovered that
  UUID v2 tokens processed by the V3 API are incorrectly updated and get their "issued_at"
  time regenerated (CVE-2014-5252). Brant Knudson discovered that the MySQL token
  driver stores expiration dates incorrectly which prevents manual revocation (CVE-2014-5251)
  and that domain-scoped tokens don''t get revoked when the domain is disabled (CVE-2014-5253).
  Tokens impacted by one of these bugs may allow a user to evade token revocation.
  Only Keystone setups configured to use revocation events are affected.'
