advisory-title: 'Path traversal issues registering malicious images using EC2 API'

advisory-description: 'David Black reported two issues in OpenStack Nova''s support
  for EC2 RegisterImage action. By registering images from malicious tarballs or manifests,
  an attacker could potentially traverse directories and overwrite files with the
  rights of the user Nova runs under. Only setups allowing the EC2 API and the S3/RegisterImage
  method for registering images are affected.'
