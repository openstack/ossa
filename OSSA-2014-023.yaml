title: 'Multiple XSS vulnerabilities in Horizon'

description: 'Jason Hullinger from Hewlett Packard, Craig Lorentzen from Cisco and
  Michael Xin from Rackspace reported 3 cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities
  in Horizon. A malicious Orchestration template owner or catalog may conduct an XSS
  attack once a corrupted template is used in the Orchestration/Stack section of Horizon.
  A malicious Horizon user may store an XSS attack by creating a network with a corrupted
  name. A malicious Horizon administrator may store an XSS attack by creating a user
  with a corrupted email address. Once executed in a legitimate context these attacks
  may result in potential asset stealing (horizon user/admin access credentials, VMs/Network
  configuration/management, tenants'' confidential information, etc.). All Horizon
  setups are affected.'
