advisory-title: 'Nova fails to verify image virtual size'

advisory-description: 'Loganathan Parthipan publicly reported a vulnerability in Nova.
  Nova did not implement checking for the virtual size of a qcow2 image used as ephemeral
  storage for instances. It is therefore possible for a user to create an image which
  has a large virtual size, but little data. Once the instance is created, the user
  can then proceed to fill the virtual disk, and consume all available disk on the
  host node file system. '
