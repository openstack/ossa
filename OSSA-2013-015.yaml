title: 'Authentication bypass when using LDAP backend'

description: 'Jose Castro Leon from CERN reported a vulnerability in the way the Keystone
  LDAP backend authenticates users. When provided with an empty password, the backend
  would perform an anonymous LDAP bind that would result in successfully authenticating
  the user.  An attacker could therefore easily impersonate and get valid tokens for
  any user. Only Keystone setups using LDAP authentication backend are affected.'
