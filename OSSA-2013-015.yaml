advisory-title: 'Authentication bypass when using LDAP backend'

advisory-description: 'Jose Castro Leon from CERN reported a vulnerability in the
  way the Keystone LDAP backend authenticates users. When provided with an empty password,
  the backend would perform an anonymous LDAP bind that would result in successfully
  authenticating the user.  An attacker could therefore easily impersonate and get
  valid tokens for any user. Only Keystone setups using LDAP authentication backend
  are affected.'
