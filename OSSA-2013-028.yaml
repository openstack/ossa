title: 'Unintentional role granting with Keystone LDAP backend'

description: 'The IBM OpenStack test team reported a vulnerability in role change
  code within the Keystone LDAP backend. When a role on a tenant is removed from a
  user, and that user doesn''t have that role on the tenant, then the user may actually
  be granted the role on the tenant. A user could use social engineering and leverage
  that vulnerability to get extra roles granted, or may accidentally be granted extra
  roles. Only Keystone setups using a LDAP backend are affected.'
