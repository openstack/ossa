advisory-title: 'Unintentional role granting with Keystone LDAP backend'

advisory-description: 'The IBM OpenStack test team reported a vulnerability in role
  change code within the Keystone LDAP backend. When a role on a tenant is removed
  from a user, and that user doesn''t have that role on the tenant, then the user
  may actually be granted the role on the tenant. A user could use social engineering
  and leverage that vulnerability to get extra roles granted, or may accidentally
  be granted extra roles. Only Keystone setups using a LDAP backend are affected.'
